## Description

This app is a tutorial app to learn NestJs. The basic idea is to get a sale estimate of your car,
based on make/model/year/mileage. Users need to sign in to get access for the function. They
can also submit their own sale data to make the data provided by the application more accurate.
These submitted sales must be approved by the admin users.
